# Future Development Ideas

This document outlines potential future enhancements and features for the TimeBasedStorage library.

## Planned Enhancements

### Additional Storage Implementations

1. **LSM-Tree Storage**
   - Implement a Log-Structured Merge Tree storage option optimized for high write throughput
   - Suitable for applications with extremely write-heavy workloads
   - Would provide efficient compaction strategies for time-series data

2. **Chunked Time-Series Storage**
   - Implement a storage that partitions data into time-based chunks
   - Provides efficient operations on recent data while allowing older data to be compressed or archived
   - Automatic roll-over capabilities based on time or size thresholds

3. **Memory-Mapped File Backed Storage**
   - Persistence layer that uses memory-mapped files for efficient I/O
   - Provides durability while maintaining high performance
   - Would allow for datasets larger than available RAM

### Feature Enhancements

1. **Aggregation Operations**
   - Add support for common time-series aggregations (min, max, avg, count, sum)
   - Support for downsampling operations (e.g., hourly averages from per-minute data)
   - Statistical functions for time-series analysis

2. **Advanced Query Capabilities**
   - Value-based filtering for range queries (e.g., timestamps where value > threshold)
   - Pattern matching for time-series data
   - Support for more complex time-based queries (e.g., find gaps or find periods of high activity)

3. **Streaming Support**
   - Real-time streaming API for continuous data ingestion
   - Support for windowed operations on streams
   - Integration with Kotlin Flow for reactive programming

4. **Persistence Options**
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization to disk
   - Incremental persistence for change-only writes
   - Point-in-time recovery options

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Multi-Threading Enhancements**
   - Specialized concurrent implementations for specific storage types
   - Fine-grained locking strategies for higher throughput
   - Lock-free alternatives where applicable

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Compressed storage options for values
   - Off-heap storage for very large datasets
   - Delta encoding for timestamps to reduce memory footprint

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - LRU cache for frequently accessed time ranges
   - Predictive prefetching for sequential access patterns
   - Query result caching

### Developer Experience

1. **Enhanced DSL**
   - A more fluent Kotlin DSL for creating and querying storage
   - Type-safe builders for complex queries
   - Extension functions for common operations

2. **Visualization Tools**
   - Simple visualization utilities for time-series data
   - Export options for charting libraries
   - Debug views for performance and memory usage

3. **Additional Testing Tools**
   - Specialized generators for time-series data
   - Property-based testing helpers
   - Performance testing fixtures

## Community Contributions

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

1. **Additional Storage Implementations**
   - Specialized implementations for specific use cases
   - Wrappers for existing time-series databases

2. **Language/Platform Support**
   - Java API compatibility layer
   - Multi-platform support (Kotlin/JS, Kotlin/Native)

3. **Integration Libraries**
   - Spring Boot integration
   - Ktor integration
   - Integration with monitoring tools

## Prioritization Criteria

Future enhancements will be prioritized based on:

1. Community needs and requests
2. Performance impact
